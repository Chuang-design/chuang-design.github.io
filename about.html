      <p>My name is Chuang Chen.</p>
      <p>
        I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at University of California at Berkeley, advised by Prof. Lining Yao at Morphing Matter Lab. I’m interested in exploring novel materials and hardware that enable unique interactivities beyond conventional computing devices, and the computational design and fabrication technologies that provide powerful tools for people to propel the trend forward. I believe that computers in the future should bridge the digital and physical worlds in a seamless and natural manner, thus weaving “Physical Intelligence” into the fabric of everyday life.

      <p>
        I have earned a B.Eng. in Automation and a B.F.A. in Product Design from the interdisciplinary program of Creative Design and Intelligent Engineering in Xinya College, Tsinghua University with outstanding award, and a M.F.A desgree in Information and Art Design also from Tsinghua University. I have research experience in many labs, including HCIE Group at CSAIL MIT, Tangible Media Group at Media Lab MIT, and Media and Interaction Lab, the Future Lab, and Pervasive HCI Group at Tsinghua University.
